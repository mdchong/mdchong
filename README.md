### Hello to you and the world! ðŸ‘‹ðŸŒŽ

**A little bit about me and my ongoing journey... ðŸ’ƒ**

<p>My name is Michelle Chong, and I'm a UI designer + frontend developer who's obsessed with making things beautiful and functional. I've always been into puzzles, disassembling and assembling things, organizing, and labeling, which this kind of addiction brought me to Arizona State University, majoring in Graphic Information Technology.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I design to deliver the gut feeling of a brand, something you don't just see, but actually feel.</p>

<p>âš¡ Fun fact: ...</p>
<p>I love cleaning for fun (it's like debugging but for real life..).</p>
