**A little bit about me and my ongoing journey... 💃**

<p>My name is Michelle D. Chong. I was born and raised as a military child in Seoul, Korea, all my life. My simple desire to learn how to code made me a student at Arizona State University, majoring in Graphic Information Technology (Full-Stack Web Development). 👩‍💻 My curiosity about how people on the other side of the world live brought me to the chill vibes of Sydney, Australia, for several months for a working holiday. After my journey here in Australia, I am willing to explore several more countries and move to Arizona! So, here I am, living out my dreams of coding and traveling the world, one line of code and one stamp in my passport at a time.</p>

<p>The allure of bringing designs to life captivates me and draws me deeper into front-end web development. I've discovered that my passion for organizing and attention to detail seamlessly intertwine with my love for coding. I find joy in organizing and cleaning up code. It gives me fulfillment and satisfaction when tidying up codes, seeing elements all aligned, and watching everything fall into its designated places (FYI - I clean the house and organize for fun 🧹).</p>
