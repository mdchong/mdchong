### Hello to you and the world! 👋🌎

**A little bit about me and my ongoing journey... 💃**

<p>My name is Michelle Chong, and I am addicted to disassembling and assembling things back together, puzzles, organizing, and labeling! This addiction brought me to the 🌎 of front-end web development and to Arizona State University, majoring in Graphic Information Technology (Full-Stack Web Development). 👩‍💻 My curiosity about how people on the other side of the world live brought me to the chill vibes of Sydney, Australia, for several months for a working holiday. Now? in Arizona, living out my dreams of coding and traveling the world, one line of code and one stamp in my passport at a time. 🥳🎉</p>

<p>⚡ Fun fact: ...</p>
<p>Most of you may have assumed.. But I clean the house for fun and indulgence! 🤫</p>
